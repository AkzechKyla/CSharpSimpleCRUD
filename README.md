# CSharpSimpleCRUD - Fun Run Registration App

## Description
This project serves as a hands-on assignment for my subject **COMP 019: Applications Development and Emerging Technologies**. The goal was to apply the technologies and concepts taught during the course, and it focuses on creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for a fun run registration system.

## Features

### CREATE:
- **Participant Registration**: Register participants for the fun run event.
- **Submit Event**: Add new events to the system.

### READ:
- **Participants List**: View a list of all participants.
- **Events List**: View a list of all events.

### UPDATE:
- **Participant Info**: Update participant information.
- **Event Info**: Update event details.

### DELETE:
- **Participant Info**: Remove participant records.
- **Event Info**: Remove event records.

## Tech Stack
- **C#**
- **Bootstrap**
- **Visual Studio Community**
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**
- **Entity Framework** (Code First for Events Table)
- **ADO.NET** (for Participants Table)
- **SQL Server** (Database)

### P.S.
*This is only a practice project for me, and I don't have any intentions on beautifying the UI or extending the features at this stage. The purpose of this project is to apply the concepts learned in the course and gain hands-on experience.*
